# diabetes-prediction-using-machine-learning-with-python
this is a tuturial on how to build and implement a supervised machine learning model,support vector machine from scratch.
And use it to predict wheather a person is diabetic or not( diabetic prediction).
I have written support vector machine model and used it to predict diabetes.you can find the code here -https://github.com/kallab-21/diabetes-prediction-using-machine-learning-with-python/blob/main/implementing_svm_classifier_from_scratch_in_python%20and%20deployement.py
